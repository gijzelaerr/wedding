                <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

                <h4>Wat about, COVID-19, Malaria or other diseases?</h4>
                <p class="justify">
                    There is no yellow fever or malaria in central Namibia but if you plan on traveling north to the
                    Zambezi Region or east to Botswana then malaria medication is recommended. Check the <a
                        href="https://klmhealthservices.com/en/inentingen/namibia/">KLM health services</a> website for
                    more information. If you aren't vaccinated for COVID-19 please do a test 24 hours before the wedding
                    to protect yourself and the others.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    <b>Entering into Namibia:</b>
                    Everyone coming into Namibia will need a full PCR test not older than 7 days (calculated from the
                    date
                    that the sample for testing was taken) at the time of entry into Namibia. This requirement also
                    applies
                    to anyone who has been vaccinated against COVID-19 â€“ a negative test must still be produced before
                    entry
                    into the country. Please be aware that only PCR tests from "Trusted Travel" laboratories in South
                    Africa will be accepted. This includes Pathcare, Biolabs and many others.
                    Check <a href=": https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/">this Website</a> and let us know if you have
                    any questions.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    <b>Leaving Namibia:</b>
                    South Africa also required PCR tests at this stage. We are trying our best to arrange testing on the
                    day of the wedding on the farm for those of you with flights the next day(s). Please let us know
                    in the RSVP form if you will need a PCR test.
                </p>

                <h4>How do I get to the Windhoek airport?</h4>
                <p class="justify">
                    From Europe: Lufthansa/Eurowings is currently the only airline that has a direct flight from Europe
                    to Windhoek. We recommend booking early as it is expensive. If you don't mind a longer flight,
                    Ethiopia Airlines is a good and reliable option .

                    From SA: FlyNamibia is a very good airline and brand new in Namibia. We recommend flying from Cape
                    own with them. SA Airlink also has regular flights.
                </p>

                <h4>How do I get to the farm?</h4>
                <p class="justify">
                    You can rent a car (it does not need to be four-wheel-drive) from Windhoek Airport. Our farm is
                    located 7km west of the town of Okahandja, which is about an hour and a half drive from the airport.
                    We will send detailed directions closer to the time. If you prefer we can arrange a pick up for you
                    from the airport. Let us know!
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    If you plan on traveling in Namibia before or after the wedding, we recommend that you rent a 4x4
                    with camping equipment and a rooftop tent. This costs about â‚¬60 a day for the car and camping
                    equipment. There are several car/camping hire businesses in Namibia,
                    <a href="https://safaricarrentalnamibia.com/">here is one we have tried before</a>.
                </p>

                <h4>Where will I sleep?</h4>
                <p class="justify">
                <ul>
                    <li class="justify">We recommend renting a 4x4 and camping on the farm (see above).</li>
                    <li class="justify">If you prefer a bit more luxury we recommend staying at the
                        <a href="https://www.okahandjahotel.com/en/">Okahandja Country Hotel</a> on the outskirts of
                        Okahandja. We have
                        arranged a discounted price of NAD1200 (80 euro) per night for our guests. Please book your stay
                        here yourself and let them know that you are a guest of the Galloway wedding. You will need to
                        pay a deposit to secure your booking ). We will be providing
                        a shuttle service between the Okahandja Hotel and our farm for the wedding - this is a 15-minute
                        drive.
                    </li>
                    <li class="justify">If you prefer to camp without your own vehicle we have a lot of space on the
                        farm for camping. Camping equipment is
                        <a href="http://camping-hire-namibia.com/">available for rental</a>.

                        you out!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>


                <h4>Which places should I visit in Namibia?</h4>
                <p class="justify">
                    This is very dependent on your budget and the time you have available. Namibia is huge and
                    never-ending, donâ€™t forget that most roads are not tarred and the speed limit is 100km/hour on all C
                    grade (gravel) roads. We canâ€™t stress this enough! This is nothing like Europe!!! 500km should be
                    seen as a full days drive.


                    Here are some ideas for a road trip, starting at one or two days and ending at 7-10 days.


                <h3>ROAD TRIP</h3>

                <p class="justify">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Windhoek, 45 minutes from the farm</b>.
                        Should not be on your bucket list. It has a slightly charming main road and nice surrounding
                        mountains but you will see enough on your drive through Windhoek towards the farm. However, if
                        you do want to spend a night there, there are several nice restaurants and craft shops.
                    </li>

                    <li><b><a href="https://erindi.com/">Erindi Game Lodge</a>, 2 hours away from the farm.</b>
                        This is one of the biggest game farms in Namibia. This is a good spot for a quick game drive and
                        to
                        catch the Big 5 in one day.
                    </li>
                    <li><b><a href="https://otjiwa.com.na/">Otjiwa Game Lodge</a>, 2 hours away.</b> A smaller game farm
                        with good reviews.
                    </li>
                    <li><b><a href="http://www.spitzkoppe.com/">Spitzkoppe campsite</a>,2 hours.</b> this is a beautiful
                        campsite with granite peaks. If you only have one spare day this is a good place to spend a
                        night at.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Gondwana lodges</b> are established all over Namibia and in the most beautiful locations. Our
                        favourites are Palmwag (7 hoursâ€™ drive from the farm), in Damaraland and <a

                    <li><b><a href="https://www.etoshanationalpark.org/">Etosha game park</a>, 6 hours drive.</b> A
                        beautiful salt pan with all the wildlife and birds you could hope for. There are several lodges
                        and campsites scattered around the park - Okaukuejo Camp, Dolomite
                        and Namutoni Camp are our favourites.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Swakopmund, 3.5 hours away.</b> a quaint German beach town on the border of the Namib desert.
                        Here you can relax at the beach (beware, it is cold Atlantic sea!), ride a camel through the
                        dunes, go duneboarding and kayak along the seal colony. This is a very cute town to spend two
                        days in. Mola Mola or Laguna boat/catamaran trips in the Walvis Bay harbour are an amazing way
                        to see the seal colonies and sand dunes. If you have spare euros, book into the <a
                                href="http://www.pelicanpoint-lodge.com/">Pelican Point lodge</a> or <a

                    <li><b><a href="http://www.sossusvlei.org">Sossusvlei</a>, 7 hours away.</b> Here you will find some
                        of the most famous
                        images of Namibia-dunes and dead trees! It is definitely on some peoples bucket list, but beware
                        it can be very
                        touristy. The surrounding areas (<a href="http://www.namibrand.com/">Namibrand</a> nature

                    <li><b>Damaraland and Kaokaland, 2 days drive.</b> One of the most scenic and rugged areas of
                        Namibia with lots of wildlife (not on game farms), beautiful mountains and savannah.
                        Kunene and Caprivi region (2 days away)</b> The greener, lusher part of Namibia with the biggest
                        rivers, crocodiles and elephants. Beautiful camp sites are camp Divundu (highly recommended),
                        Kwando,
                        and <a hjef="https://ngepicamp.com/">Ngepi camp</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Chobe Elephant Park & Botswana, 2-3 days drive.</b> If you are feeling adventurous and have a
                        7-10 days, take a trip through Namibia to Chobe, Moremi or the Okavango Delta. Victoria Falls is
                        also in
                        this area. There are several tour companies that offer guided tours with camping. Self-drive is
                        possible
                        but requires good 4x4 skills and a lot of bravery!
                    </li>

                    <li>If you feel like laying back and having someone else do the hard work, why not book a
                        guided tour? Gondwana does this too but there are seferal safari tours available from Windhoek
                        and you can request that they pick you up in Okahandja.
