                    The Galloway farm turns 100 and Ali G turns the big 3-0. We sincerely hope that you can make it out
                    to most of what we have lined up to celebrate these two occasions!
                    The festivities will commence on the weekend of Friday the 2nd of September on the Galloway farm in
                    Okahandja, Namibia. This first weekend will be a toast to the history and memories that so many of
                    us have while calling this place home.
                    Almost to the day Stephan Galloway first laid claim to this dust-patch we now call home. It has seen
                    many a generation come through, and will guide the way for many more to come.

                    I
                    have hijacked Abi’s birthday day, so we plan to make it a big one celebrating all. (We will probably
                    have at least two other 30ths on this day as well, so don’t miss out).
                    For most of my friends, this will be the main event to aim to make.

                <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

                <h4>What about,  Malaria or other diseases?</h4>
                <p class="justify">
                    There is no yellow fever or malaria in central Namibia but if you plan on traveling north to the
                    Zambezi Region or east to Botswana then malaria medication is recommended.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    <b>Entering into Namibia:</b>
                    Everyone coming into Namibia will need a full PCR test not older than 7 days (calculated from the
                    date
                    that the sample for testing was taken) at the time of entry into Namibia. This requirement also
                    applies
                    to anyone who has been vaccinated against COVID-19 – a negative test must still be produced before
                    entry
                    into the country. Please be aware that only PCR tests from "Trusted Travel" laboratories in South
                    Africa will be accepted. This includes Pathcare, Biolabs and many others.
                    Check <a href="https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/">this Website</a> and let us know if you have
                    any questions.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    <b>Leaving Namibia:</b>
                    South Africa also requires PCR tests at this stage. We are trying our best to arrange testing on the
                    day of the wedding on the farm for those of you with flights the next day(s). Please let us know
                    in the RSVP form if you will need a PCR test.
                </p>

                <h4>How do I get to the Windhoek airport?</h4>
                <p class="justify">
                    From SA: FlyNamibia is a very good airline and brand new in Namibia. We recommend flying from Cape
                    own with them. SA Airlink also has regular flights.
                </p>

                <h4>How do I get to the farm?</h4>
                <p class="justify">
                    You can rent a car (it does not need to be four-wheel-drive) from Windhoek Airport. Our farm is
                    located 7km west of the town of Okahandja, which is about an hour and a half drive from the airport.
                    We will send detailed directions closer to the time. If you prefer we can arrange a pick up for you
                    from the airport. Let us know!
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    If you plan on traveling in Namibia before or after we recommend that you rent a 4x4
                    with camping equipment and a rooftop tent. This costs about 1000 ZAR a day for the car and camping
                    equipment. There are several car/camping hire businesses in Namibia,
                    <a href="https://safaricarrentalnamibia.com/">here is one we have tried before</a>.
                </p>

                <h4>Which places should I visit in Namibia?</h4>
                <p class="justify">
                    This is very dependent on your budget and the time you have available. Namibia is huge and
                    never-ending, don’t forget that most roads are not tarred and the speed limit is 100km/hour on all C
                    grade (gravel) roads.

                    Here are some ideas for a road trip, starting at one or two days and ending at 7-10 days.


                <h3>ROAD TRIP</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="offset-lg-3 col-lg-6">
                <p class="justify">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Windhoek, 45 minutes from the farm</b>.
                        Should not be on your bucket list. It has a slightly charming main road and nice surrounding
                        mountains but you will see enough on your drive through Windhoek towards the farm. However, if
                        you do want to spend a night there, there are several nice restaurants and craft shops.
                    </li>

                    <li><b><a href="https://erindi.com/">Erindi Game Lodge</a>, 2 hours away from the farm.</b>
                        This is one of the biggest game farms in Namibia. This is a good spot for a quick game drive and

                        with good reviews.

                    <li><b><a href="http://www.spitzkoppe.com/">Spitzkoppe campsite</a>,2 hours.</b> this is a beautiful
                        campsite with granite peaks. If you only have one spare day this is a good place to spend a
                        night at.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Gondwana lodges</b> are established all over Namibia and in the most beautiful locations. Our
                        favourites are Palmwag (7 hours’ drive from the farm), in Damaraland and <a

                    <li><b><a href="https://www.etoshanationalpark.org/">Etosha game park</a>, 6 hours drive.</b> A
                        beautiful salt pan with all the wildlife and birds you could hope for. There are several lodges
                        and campsites scattered around the park - Okaukuejo Camp, Dolomite
                        and Namutoni Camp are our favourites.

                    <li><b>Swakopmund, 3.5 hours away.</b> a quaint German beach town on the border of the Namib desert.
                        Here you can relax at the beach (beware, it is cold Atlantic sea!), ride a camel through the
                        dunes, go duneboarding and kayak along the seal colony. This is a very cute town to spend two
                        days in. Mola Mola or Laguna boat/catamaran trips in the Walvis Bay harbour are an amazing way
                        to see the seal colonies and sand dunes. If you have spare rands, book into the <a
                                href="http://www.pelicanpoint-lodge.com/">Pelican Point lodge</a> or <a

                    <li><b><a href="http://www.sossusvlei.org">Sossusvlei</a>, 7 hours away.</b> Here you will find some
                        of the most famous
                        images of Namibia-dunes and dead trees! It is definitely on some peoples bucket list, but beware
                        it can be very
                        touristy. The surrounding areas (<a href="http://www.namibrand.com/">Namibrand</a> nature

                            mountain park</a>) are, in our opinion, more beautiful and isolated.

                    <li><b>Damaraland and Kaokaland, 2 days drive.</b> One of the most scenic and rugged areas of
                        Namibia with lots of wildlife (not on game farms), beautiful mountains and savannah.
                        Kunene and Caprivi region (2 days away)</b> The greener, lusher part of Namibia with the biggest
                        rivers, crocodiles and elephants. Beautiful camp sites are camp Divundu (highly recommended),
                        Kwando,
                        and <a hjef="https://ngepicamp.com/">Ngepi camp</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Chobe Elephant Park & Botswana, 2-3 days drive.</b> If you are feeling adventurous and have a
                        7-10 days, take a trip through Namibia to Chobe, Moremi or the Okavango Delta. Victoria Falls is
                        also in
                        this area. There are several tour companies that offer guided tours with camping. Self-drive is
                        possible
                        but requires good 4x4 skills and a lot of bravery!
                    </li>

                    <li>If you feel like laying back and having someone else do the hard work, why not book a
                        guided tour? Gondwana does this too but there are seferal safari tours available from Windhoek
                        and you can request that they pick you up in Okahandja.

                <h3>HIKING</h3>

                Fish river canyon: The second biggest canyon in the world. You can do the whole hike – 80km over 5 days
                or a shorter version- 40 km over three days (Klipspringer trail). This needs to be booked far in
                advance.
                Naukluft Waterkloof trail (17km) or Olive Trail (10km)
                NamibRand tok tokkie trail: three days guided walk through the desert with a guide and outdoor camping.
                This is highly recommended.

                    <li>The <a href="https://gondwana-collection.com/">Gondwana Collection</a> is a great way to see Namibia. If you are interested, I would recommend buying a Gondwana
                        card which gives SADC members up to 50% off at lodges/campsites/etc. A must have if you plan to
                        see Namibia and stay at their spots. The last I checked it was a once off fee of R300.</li>
